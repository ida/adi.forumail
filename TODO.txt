- username = fullname, if no fullname, take id

- Send mail to address prefixed with category, e.g. 'developers@plone.org', contentrule applies tag to it

- Tags must be in last line, like: [tag1, tag2], optionallly regard quotes possibly out of habit included by user.

- Dedicated CT for a forum? would be merely for binding configurations to it, instead of relying on path '/siteId/forumail'.

- install-script: sett source-field (='To:'-address) in contenrule
